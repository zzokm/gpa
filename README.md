## ✨ What you get

- **Add courses in seconds** — Type a course code or name and get suggestions; credit hours and names fill in automatically.
- **Letter grades A+ to F** — Choose your grade; the app uses the official FCAI 4.0 scale.

- **Live GPA** — Your GPA updates as you add or change courses, with a simple “Excellent / Good / Acceptable” style label.
- **Import from the portal** — Paste your registered courses from the FCAI portal and let the app sort them by level and term.
- **Groups that make sense** — Courses grouped by level and term; expand or collapse and see group stats (GPA, credits, pass/fail).
- **Undo “Clear All”** — Cleared everything by mistake? A short countdown bar lets you bring your list back with one click.
- **English & Arabic** — Switch language with the globe icon; the app supports Egyptian Arabic (ar-EG) with the right fonts.
- **Stays on your device** — Your courses and preferences are saved in your browser so you can pick up where you left off.
